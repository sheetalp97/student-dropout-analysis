# Student Dropout Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes factors that may contribute to student dropout rates. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis are used to explore potential relationships between various student characteristics (e.g., high school GPA, age, enrollment status) and dropout. This project was completed as part of the coursework for the "Principles of Business Intelligence" foundation course during my Masters in Information Systems degree in 2024.

## Data Description

The dataset includes information on a sample of students, including:

*   `HS_GPA`: High School GPA
*   `Unit_Enrolled`: Number of units enrolled
*   `Age`: Student age
*   `Gender_F`: Gender (1 if female, 0 if male)
*   `Registered_Full_Time`: Full-time enrollment status (1 if yes, 0 if no)
*   `Commuter_Student`: Commuter student status (1 if yes, 0 if no)
*   `Seminar_Attended`: Attendance at a seminar (1 if yes, 0 if no)
*   `Dropped_out`: Whether the student dropped out (1 if yes, 0 if no)

## Files

*   `Dropout_Analysis_Data.xlsx`: Contains the raw data used for the analysis.
*   `Dropout_Analysis_Descriptive.xlsx`: Includes descriptive statistics visualizations of the data.
*   `Dropout_Analysis_Viz.xlsx`: Includes more advanced visualizations related to dropout analysis.
*   `Dropout_Analysis_SPSS_Output.spv`: Contains SPSS output from statistical analyses.
*   `Dropout_Analysis_Report.pdf`: A detailed report outlining the methodology, findings, and conclusions of the dropout analysis.

## Technologies Used

*   SPSS: For statistical analysis and generation of the output file.
*   Microsoft Excel: For data storage and initial analysis.
